# kodeWeave Touch
kodeWeave Touch is a realtime coding playground for HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Similar to [JSFiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/) and [JSBin](http://jsbin.com/), but kodeWeave Touch was made specifically for mobile devices. While also giving you the option to export as a desktop application and/or a chrome application.

There is also kodeWeave Editor [[public repository]](https://github.com/mikethedj4/kodeWeave) which is not touch friendly, but gives you some more extended features that kodeWeave Touch has not incorporated like multiple files.
